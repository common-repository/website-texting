LEADsms offers WordPress webmasters an easy way to support their site visitors and generate leads and new business via SMS / text message.

== Description ==

LEADsms connects your WordPress powered web site to our [CONNECTsms business texting platform](https://localtextmarketers.com/) via a web widget.
When the form is submitted, its message content and phone number is sent securely to your CONNECTsms account, where you can now chat with your visitor via SMS/text message.

A valid CONNECTsms subscription is required to use LEADsms (subscriptions start at $39.99/month).
Use of the branded plugin is free with any subscription, while a non-branded version is available for an additional $9.99/month.   

Note: Currently LEADsms is available for webmasters in Canada and the United States, but other countries may be supported in the near future. 
If you are outside of either jurisdiction and are interested in using the plugin, send us a note and we'll see what we can do to help.
